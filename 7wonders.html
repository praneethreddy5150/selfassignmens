                <p>The Great Wall of China is one of the most remarkable architectural achievements in human history,
                    built primarily to protect Chinese states and empires from invasions by northern nomadic tribes.
                    Construction of the wall began as early as the 7th century BC, but it was first unified and expanded
                    under Emperor Qin Shi Huang around 221 BC after he united China. Over the centuries, several
                    dynasties continued building and strengthening it, with the most well-preserved sections constructed
                    during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644). The wall stretches approximately 21,196 kilometers, making it
                    the longest man-made structure in the world. Beyond military defense, it also helped regulate trade
                    and transportation along the famous Silk Road. Although many believe it is visible from space, this
                    is largely a myth. Due to its immense historical and cultural importance, the Great Wall was
                    designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 and remains one of the New Seven Wonders of the
                    World.</p>

                <p>Petra, located in southern Jordan, is an ancient city famous for its rock-cut architecture and
                    advanced water management system, and it is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It was
                    established as early as the 4th century BC by the Nabataeans, an Arab tribe who made Petra their
                    capital and transformed it into a major trading hub connecting Arabia, Egypt, and the Mediterranean
                    regions. The Nabataeans became wealthy by controlling important trade routes for spices, silk, and
                    incense, and they carved magnificent structures directly into the red sandstone cliffs, which is why
                    Petra is often called the “Rose City.” One of its most iconic monuments is Al-Khazneh (The
                    Treasury), along with other impressive structures like Ad Deir (The Monastery), the Royal Tombs, and
                    an ancient Roman-style theater. In 106 AD, Petra was annexed by the Roman Empire, which further
                    developed the city, but over time, changes in trade routes and several powerful earthquakes led to
                    its decline and eventual abandonment. Petra remained largely unknown to the Western world until it
                    was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Today, it is a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site (since 1985) and stands as a symbol of Jordan’s rich history and architectural
                    brilliance.</p>

                <p>Christ the Redeemer is a world-famous statue of Jesus Christ located at the summit of Mount Corcovado
                    in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and it is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. The idea for the
                    statue was first proposed in the mid-19th century, but the project officially began in the 1920s as
                    a symbol of Christianity and peace in Brazil. Construction started in 1922 and was completed in
                    1931, with the statue being designed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa and sculpted by
                    French artist Paul Landowski, while the face was created by Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida. The
                    monument stands approximately 30 meters (98 feet) tall, with arms stretching 28 meters (92 feet)
                    wide, and it sits on an 8-meter pedestal, making its total height about 38 meters. It is made of
                    reinforced concrete and covered with thousands of small triangular soapstone tiles, which were
                    chosen for their durability and smooth finish. The statue represents Jesus with open arms,
                    symbolizing peace, protection, and welcome to the people of Brazil and visitors from around the
                    world. In 2007, it was officially named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World, and in 2012 it
                    was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites as part of Rio de Janeiro’s cultural landscape,
                    remaining one of the most recognized landmarks globally.</p>

                <p>Machu Picchu is an ancient Incan city located high in the Andes Mountains of Peru, near the city of
                    Cusco, and it is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It was built in the 15th century during
                    the reign of the Inca emperor Pachacuti and is believed to have served as a royal estate, religious
                    site, or ceremonial center for the Inca civilization. Constructed around 1450 AD, Machu Picchu
                    showcases the Incas’ advanced engineering skills, with precisely cut stone structures built without
                    mortar, agricultural terraces carved into steep mountain slopes, and a sophisticated water drainage
                    system. The city includes important structures such as the Temple of the Sun, the Intihuatana stone
                    (a ritual stone associated with astronomy), and the Room of the Three Windows. Machu Picchu was
                    abandoned in the 16th century, likely due to the Spanish conquest, although the Spanish never
                    discovered the site. It remained largely unknown to the outside world until it was brought to
                    international attention in 1911 by American historian and explorer Hiram Bingham. Today, Machu
                    Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (since 1983) and a symbol of the architectural brilliance and
                    cultural richness of the Inca Empire, attracting millions of visitors from around the world each
                    year.</p>

                <p>Chichén Itzá is an ancient Mayan city located in the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico and is one of the
                    New Seven Wonders of the World. It was founded around the 6th century AD and became one of the most
                    powerful and influential cities of the Maya civilization between the 9th and 12th centuries. The
                    city served as a major political, economic, and religious center, showcasing the advanced knowledge
                    of the Maya in astronomy, mathematics, and architecture. Its most famous structure is the Temple of
                    Kukulcán (El Castillo), a massive step pyramid dedicated to the feathered serpent god Kukulcán,
                    which is designed with precise astronomical alignment—during the spring and autumn equinoxes,
                    sunlight creates a shadow that resembles a serpent descending the pyramid’s steps. Other significant
                    structures include the Great Ball Court, one of the largest in Mesoamerica, the Temple of the
                    Warriors, and the Sacred Cenote, a natural sinkhole used for religious ceremonies and offerings.
                    Chichén Itzá shows evidence of both Mayan and Toltec cultural influences, indicating strong trade
                    and cultural connections. The city began to decline in the 13th century for reasons that are still
                    debated by historians, including political conflict and environmental factors. Today, it is a UNESCO
                    World Heritage Site (since 1988) and remains one of the most important and visited archaeological
                    sites in Mexico.</p>

                <p>The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an ancient Roman arena located in the
                    center of Rome, Italy, and it is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Construction began in
                    70–72 AD under Emperor Vespasian of the Flavian dynasty and was completed in 80 AD by his son Titus,
                    with later modifications made by Emperor Domitian. Built primarily from limestone, concrete, and
                    volcanic stone, the Colosseum could hold an estimated 50,000 to 80,000 spectators, making it the
                    largest amphitheater ever constructed in the Roman Empire. It was used for public spectacles such as
                    gladiator contests, animal hunts (venationes), mock naval battles, executions, and dramatic
                    performances, serving both as entertainment and as a demonstration of Roman power and engineering
                    brilliance. The structure features a complex system of vaults, corridors, and underground chambers
                    known as the hypogeum, where animals and gladiators were kept before contests. Over the centuries,
                    the Colosseum suffered damage from earthquakes, stone robbers, and neglect, especially after the
                    fall of the Western Roman Empire, but it remains a powerful symbol of ancient Rome. In 1980, it was
                    designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and today it stands as one of the most visited historical
                    monuments in the world, representing the grandeur and cultural legacy of the Roman civilization.</p>

                    Yamuna River, and it is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. It was commissioned in 1632 by
                    the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died during childbirth
                    in 1631, and construction was completed around 1653, taking approximately 20 years and involving
                    thousands of artisans and craftsmen from across Asia. Designed in a blend of Mughal, Persian,
                    Islamic, and Indian architectural styles, the monument is renowned for its perfect symmetry,
                    intricate carvings, calligraphy, and the use of precious and semi-precious stones in a technique
                    known as pietra dura. The central dome rises about 73 meters (240 feet) high and is surrounded by
                    four slender minarets, while the entire complex includes a mosque, a guest house, and beautifully
                    landscaped Mughal gardens arranged in a charbagh (four-part) layout. Built primarily from white
                    marble brought from Rajasthan, the Taj Mahal changes color slightly depending on the time of day and
                    lighting conditions, adding to its beauty. It was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983
                    and remains a powerful symbol of eternal love, as well as one of the most visited and admired
                    architectural masterpieces in the world.</p>
